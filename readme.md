# Python Prep Line (PyPL)

An open source, open hardware, automated preparation line for geochemical samples. Originally designed for processing CO<sub>2</sub> samples, but should handle anything which requires:

* switching relays, valves or heating elements
* monitoring temperature sensors (e.g., PT1000 sensors; type-K thermocouples)
* monitoring MKS vacuum/pressure gauges.
* controlling stepper motors
