<h1>HELLO WORLD!</h1>

# Python Prep Line (PyPL)

An open source, open hardware, automated preparation line for geochemical samples. Originally designed for processing CO<sub>2</sub> samples, but should handle anything which requires:

* switching relays, valves or heating elements
* monitoring temperature sensors (e.g., PT1000 sensors; type-K thermocouples)
* monitoring MKS vacuum/pressure gauges.
* controlling stepper motors

## Hardware
### Motherboard
### Pyboard
### Stepper Motor Controller Board
### Temperature Readings

Up to 4 independent temperature reading. Each reading may come from either:

* a thermocouple connected to a MAX31856 chip
* a resistance temperature detector (PT1000 or PT100) connected to a MAX31865 chip

#### Thermocouple Board

* [Adafruit 3263](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3263)
* Based on MAX31856

### Relays

The pyboard communicates through I2C with a GPIO expansion board based on the MCP23017 chip, providing access to 16 input or output ports. Each of these ports is connected to a power MOSFET, providing the ability to quickly switch DC power to 16 screw terminals.

#### GPIO Expansion Board

* Based on MCP23017
* All ports are pulled low (connected to ground by 10K resistors).
* As a result, all switches are off by default.

#### Power MOSFETSs

Used to connect screw terminals to ground safely and quickly. This means that when the MOSFET is off, whatever is connected to the screw terminals will float at a moderately high DC voltage (e.g., 24Â VDC) despite being powered off, so any electrical connections should be suitably insulated.
